def apply_operations(base_string:str, operations:list) -> str:
    """
    Applies a series of operations to a base string and returns the modified string.

    Parameters:
    base_string (str): The initial string to which operations will be applied.
    operations (list of str): A list of operations to perform on the base string. 
                              Supported operations are:
                              - 'advance': Move the current index one position to the right.
                              - 'delete': Delete the character at the current index.
                              - 'replace X': Replace the character at the current index with 'X' (where 'X' is any character).
                              - 'insert X': Insert the character 'X' (where 'X' is any character) at the current index.
                              - 'kill': Remove all characters from the current index to the end of the string.

    Returns:
    str: The modified string after all operations have been applied.
